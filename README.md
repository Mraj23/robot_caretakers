# Robot Caretakers Final Project

Project by Raj, Apple and Kevin.

For our final project we implemented voice commands for the stretch RE2. This allows quadraplegic individuals to fully operate a stretch robot just by using their voice. We also implemented start/stop functionality and the ability to save and load action sequences. 

Our demonstration video is shown below!
